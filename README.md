## Wins
I was pretty psyched to deepen my understanding of data flows in React on this project. This exploration not only streamlined my code but also helped me to solve some complex challenges creatively. Managing a responsive app alongside a robust Cypress test suite was incredibly satisfying, and was particularly rewarding given the app's game-like functionality and the multitude of user paths to explore.

## Challenges

Testing proved to be more intricate than expected due to the variety of user paths within the application. Additionally, implementing responsive design posed its own set of hurdles, particularly when integrating styled components, to maintain consistency across different screen sizes. Managing state across numerous components was another significant challenge, necessitating careful implementation to maintain a cohesive UI and UX.

## Up Next 
I plan to:
- introduce animations
- refine the game levels to make a more interesting and dynamic experience
- build out the results page
- add more character and storytelling components to the main page
